    <h1>Work Experience</h1>

    <p>This page should have most/all of my work experience.</p>

    <h3>3D Printing Assistant</h3>
    <h6>Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University</h6>
    <p>In 2025, I worked as a 3D printing assistant. My main responsability was to 3D print models of important molecules, for display and educational purposes, but also to take care of the 3D printer.</p>
    <p>When printing models I was not just pushing a 'start' button on a 3D printer. I would general not design models, except for some test models, but I would have to take the provided models and fix any errors that would prevent or make printing worse, cut them up into smaller sections, and update them to print in 2 colours. From there, I would have to communicate with the person who requested the model what specifications they had for the model (colour, size, specific filament...), and slice the model with the appopriate settings. When choosing settings, it was important to have the requested specifications, but it was even more important to choose settings that would ensure a quality print and clean support removal. At this stage I would usually check with them again, especially if the model was particularly large, to ensure it would be printed as they wanted. I would then check that the correct filaments were in the printer, changing them if needed, and print the model. While printing there is not much to do, but I would be sure to check in occationally, to catch any problems if they arose.</p>
    <p>After printing, I would remove the print and clean the print bed (if needed). I would then remove the supports from the print, and sand the surface to improve feel and appearance.</p>
    <p>I was also responsable for maintenance of the 3D printers. Day to day, this would mostly just be cleaning the print beds (washing off glue), checking for problems while printing, and troubleshooting the problems that occured. I would also have to perform leveling and cleaning, but not often.</p>
    <p>(When I fix the problem with images rotating weirdly and misaligning, I will put some photos of prints here.)</p>

    <h3>Peer Tutor</h3>
    <h6>Terry Fox Secondary School</h6>
    <p>During my last two years of high school, I worked as a tutor through my school, tutoring students in classes I had already taken. While I worked through the school, I did not work for it; the school would introduce me to someone who had requested tutoring, but from there I did all the communication and planning.</p>
