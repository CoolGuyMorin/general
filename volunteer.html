    <h1>Volunteer Experience</h1>
    <p>This page should some of my volunteer and club experience. This page is not comprehensive at the moment, as I am searching for any images of myself or my group in these role. As I gain more experience in clubs and teams and as a volunteer I will divide this page up to better reflect the differences between those roles.</p>

    <h3>Terry Fox STEAM Ambassadors</h3>
    <h6>2021-2025</h6>
    <p>For my 4 years of high school, I served as a STEAM ambassador for the school. I was actually of the first people to serve as a STEAM ambassador, as the STEAM program (and with it, the need for STEAM ambassadors) only started the year I began highschool. In this role I held many responsabilities, including the creation and presentation of projects for the district STEAM fair, promotion of the STEAM program to incoming students, and serving as a role model/leader for students within the STEAM program.</p>
<p>The most important job of the STEAM ambassadors was to create a project to present at the district STEAM fair. To do this we worked together to research problems and design projects around the project theme for the year, and to create meaningful presentations to explain our project and process to a wide audience (students k-12, judges and the general public). For the 2024 fair, the theme was sustainability. For that project we researched the Blakeburn Lagoons, a local park that had was previously the site of waste settling ponds, and commited to investing the soil and water quality. We wanted to be able to figure out what was causing algae blooms and fish die-offs in the lagoons, and just generally monitor the health of the ecosystem. We did not find any conclusive results, but created a plan to continue research into the future, presenting the findings we did have and out plan at the district fair, winning us second place. Below you should see a photo of us after recieving our plaqe.</p>
    <p>As a STEAM ambassador, my responsabilities also including promoting the STEAM program at Terry Fox to incoming students from the local middle schools. This mainly involved giving short presentations to students as they toured the school and going to their schools around the time of course selection to promote to speak about our experiences with the STEAM program and explain how they can join.</p>
