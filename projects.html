    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>This page contains information about some of the projects I have done. This page in not comprehensive at the moment, but includes information about what I think are my top 2 most interesting projects. This page will likely change frequently, as I update information on current projects to reflect progress or add projects I forgot about.</p>

<h3>Weather Station</h3>
<p>I have been working on this project since 2023, presenting it at my school's STEAM fair in 2024 and in 2025. </p>
    <p>From the beginning the goal has been to collect data for analysis. In Earth Science 11 I learned about meteorology, which involves looking at data and making connections to weather phenomena. I thought this was interesting, but it could be more interesting and relevant if we learned it using weather data local to our school, as we could feel and see the weather changes ourselves. This inspired me to create a basic weather station for the school, so that I could collect data that future science classes could use when studying weather.</p>
     <p>The secondary goal of this project was to collect long-term data. Long-term data would be better for observing weather trends and patterns, which could be used in the future to make predictions, but also that I could just use to practice analyzing data. To complete this goal, I would need to complete the first and to have the device save data, and to keep the device running for long continuous periods.</p>
