  <p>On this website you should find information and images from some of my projects, as well as some general info about me.</p>

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I am a first year student in Mechatronics engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have only just started, so I have not learned much, but most of the content so far is stuff that I have done already. In high school, I took almost every tech ed class that was offered (Drafting x 2, Tech Ed, Power Tech, Metal Work, Wood Work, Automotive x 2), so I already have some experience with drafting and manufacturing, both on paper and CAD. </p>
  <p>I have also explored design outside of the classroom. Since learning about Blender in grade 9, I have enjoy tinkering around in it, trying to make artistic models. These were mainly for personal interest, but whenever I had an assignment in school where I thought I could include a 3D model or animation, I would. As I started making useful models, I began using AutoDesk Fusion, as it was an easier tool to use when I needed to 3D print something. It is also useful for visualing projects that I intend to build by hand. AutoCAD has also been usefull for me, mainly for designing parts to lasercut, as my highschool had a lasercutter which used SVG files, but also for making digital versions of my designs. Most of the time, if I was just building something by hand, drafting it on paper was sufficient.</p>

  <h4>STEAM Ambassadors</h4>
  <p>I served as a STEAM Ambassador at my high school for 4 years. In this role I did many things, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Working with the other STEAM ambassadors to research, plan, and create projects for our school and for the annual district STEAM fair</li>
    <li>Presenting our projects at the district STEAM fair, winning us funding, used to improve our school's makerspace</li>
    <li>Worked with school staff to create, promote, and run STEAM events at our school, such as the Girls In
STEAM day</li>
    <li>Served as a student leader within the STEAM program and helped staff improve the program, both as a
STEAM Ambassador and part of the first cohort to graduate through the STEAM program</li>
  </ul>
