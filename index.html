  <p>On this website you should find information and images from some of my projects, as well as some general info about me.</p>

  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I am a first year student in Mechatronics engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have only just started, so I have not learned much, but most of the content so far is stuff that I have done already. In high school, I took almost every tech ed class that was offered (Drafting x 2, Tech Ed, Power Tech, Metal Work, Wood Work, Automotive x 2), so I already have some experience with drafting and manufacturing, both on paper and CAD. </p>
  <p>I have also explored design outside of the classroom. Since learning about Blender in grade 9, I have enjoy tinkering around in it, trying to make artistic models. These were mainly for personal interest, but whenever I had an assignment in school where I thought I could include a 3D model or animation, I would. As I started making useful models, I began using AutoDesk Fusion, as it was an easier tool to use when I needed to 3D print something. It is also useful for visualing projects that I intend to build by hand. AutoCAD has also been usefull for me, mainly for designing parts to lasercut, as my highschool had a lasercutter which used SVG files, but also for making digital versions of my designs. Most of the time, if I was just building something by hand, drafting it on paper was sufficient.</p>

  <p>notice: Images are currently not working. Working to resolve this issue by the next update.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <h4>Weather Station</h4>
<p>I have been working on this project on and off since 2023. The purpose of this project was to be able to collect live and local data of the atmospheric conditions. This data was usefull for 2 reasons: the students studying earth science could use the data in their learning and I could use live data to give rough weather conditions for the school on one of my websites. I have done many different things for this project, below is a rough summary of some of the things I have done.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Built a device using a Raspberry Pi (originally an Arudino) and sensors, programmed to collect and save about the conditions of the air</li>
    <li>Designed and 3D printed a case for my device</li>
    <li>Created a basic website with HTML and CSS, and used JavaScript to display live data</li>
    <li>Used R to clean and analyze dataset, and to make graphs to show the changes in the conditions of the air</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3D Printing Assistant</h4>
  <p>Over the summer of 2025, I worked for the department of molecular biology and biochemistry st Simon Fraser University, 3D printing models of important biological compounds (ex. protiens) for display and educational demonstration.</p>
  <p>Some things I did in this job:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prepared and sliced demonstrational models for printing, with appropriate size and settings for optimal
printing</li>
    <li>Printed models and performed finishing work, such as support removal and smoothing, to improve appearance and feel of models</li>
    <li>Performed general maintenance on printers, including cleaning print bed and nozzles, changing
filaments, and minor adjustments and repairs, to ensure consistent function and quality prints</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>STEAM Ambassadors</h4>
  <p>I served as a STEAM Ambassador at my high school for 4 years. In this role I did many things, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Working with the other STEAM ambassadors to research, plan, and create projects for our school and for the annual district STEAM fair</li>
    <li>Presenting our projects at the district STEAM fair, winning us funding, used to improve our school's makerspace</li>
    <li>Worked with school staff to create, promote, and run STEAM events at our school, such as the Girls In
STEAM day</li>
    <li>Served as a student leader within the STEAM program and helped staff improve the program, both as a
STEAM Ambassador and part of the first cohort to graduate through the STEAM program</li>
  </ul>
