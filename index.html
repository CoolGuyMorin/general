  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I am a first year student in Mechatronics engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have only just started, so I have not learned much, but most of the content so far is stuff that I have done already. In high school, I took almost every tech ed class that was offered (Drafting x 2, Tech Ed, Power Tech, Metal Work, Wood Work, Automotive x 2), so I already have some experience with drafting and manufacturing, both on paper and CAD. </p>
